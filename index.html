        <h2>An explicit list of features </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mutiple arms: I expanded the starter CCD code from the lectures to include multiple arms.
                The mouse input can be used to move either 2 separate targets or a single target for the arms to reach.
            </li>
            <li>Joint Limits: The arm on the left side has a joint limit of 45 degrees. The 
                arm on the right side has no joint limits for comparison.
            </li>
            <li>User Interaction: The mouse input is used to control the position of the goals
                each goal can be moved separately using a click and drag motion. The goals can also be 
                combined to form a single goal for both arms.
            </li>
            <li>Challenge: FABRIK solver - I decided to compare a CCD solver with a FABRIK solver in 2D.
                The FABRIK solver is shown in the second video. The first thing I noticed with the FABRIK solver
                is that the animation looked more natural and used more of the joints. The CCD solver prioritized joints closest
                to the goal which sometimes made the joints close to the root straight. In more cases the FABRIK solver showed an
                arc while the CCD solver looked unnatural. I found the FABRIK solver to be more difficult to implement,
                the code needed to be adapted from the paper and involved more vector math. The FABRIK solver in the second video
                has a 90 degree limit on the joints. I found the the joint limit effect looked similar between the CCD and FABRIK
                though the FABRIK solver remained to look more natural. The joint limits on the CCD solver were trivial to implement
                since it already works with angles they just needed to be clamped as noted in the lecture. The joint limits were more difficult
                to implement in FABRIK due to it being based around positions not angles. The FABRIK solution is more math heavy and involves a cone 
                representation.

        <h2>List of tools/libraries</h2>
        <p>I used processing for the visualization. The CCD code was adapted from the lecture example. The FABRIK solver
            was based of algorithm 1 in the paper and the YouTube video linked on the canvas page.
        </p>
        <h2>difficulties encountered</h2>
        <p>The Fabrik solver was a bit difficult to understand and adapting the pseudocode from the paper was tricky. Joint limits were also difficult to implement with FABRIK</p>
